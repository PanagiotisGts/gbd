# GBD - GoBrewDock 
###### Work In Progress

A wrapper tool of TestContainers (go) that handles building and running multiple containers 
as a declarative dependency stack. It can be used as a CLI tool or embedded as a library. The inspiration for this tool
stemmed from the concept of a 'System Under Test' (SUT), often a single (Î¼)service, used during testing.
There was a need for a convenient method to create and manage the SUT's dependencies, as well as its image and configuration parameters.
In that way, the SUT can be tested in isolation, without the need to manually create and manage its dependencies and as close as possible to production.

## Features
Most of the features provided by TestContainers are supported.

A unique feature provided is the ability to declare replacements for configuration parameters (files, env vars) from
previously declared containers in the stack by utilizing a JSONPath pointer to the Docker Inspect JSON.

A library generated configuration can be dumped to a `yaml` file that can be reused, modified and executed either via the CLI
tool or the library.

Another unique feature of the CLI tool is the ability to perform hot-reload of the specified config file. This is done 
either manually or when modifying the source file, resulting in the termination and the redeployment of the containers which
were part of the stack (or new ones).

## Docker Inspect JSON Path dynamic params
 - `{NETWORK_ID}` - The ID of the network the stack is deployed to (generated)

## CLI Usage

- Dry-Run :
  - Run the deployment stack for verification, followed by a cleanup afterward.  
  - gbd dry-run --config _{config.yaml}_ --context _{context_dir}_


- Watcher :
    - Run the deployment stack and watch for changes in the source file. If a change is detected, the stack is redeployed.
    - gbd watcher --config _{config.yaml}_ --context _{context_dir}_ _[--dump true | false]_
